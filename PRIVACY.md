# Privacy Policy

**Claude Blog** is a Claude Code plugin that runs entirely on your local machine. It does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data or usage information.

## What This Plugin Does NOT Do

- Does not collect analytics or telemetry
- Does not send data to any external server (except when you explicitly use web search, API calls to CMS platforms, or MCP servers you configure)
- Does not create accounts or require authentication
- Does not store cookies or tracking identifiers
- Does not access any data outside of the files and URLs you provide to it

## Third-Party Services

When you explicitly invoke certain commands, the plugin may interact with external services **on your behalf and under your control**:

|---------|---------|------|
| AI image generation | Google Gemini API (via nanobanana-mcp) | Only when you run `/blog image` and have configured your own API key |
| Audio narration | Google Gemini TTS API | Only when you run `/blog audio` and have configured your own API key |
| Web research and fetching | Search engines, public web pages | Used by most commands for research, SERP analysis, link verification, and source checking (`/blog write`, `/blog rewrite`, `/blog analyze`, `/blog brief`, `/blog outline`, `/blog strategy`, `/blog seo-check`, `/blog factcheck`, `/blog geo`, `/blog calendar`, `/blog persona`, `/blog cannibalization`) |
| SERP and keyword data | DataForSEO API (~$0.01/call) | Only when you run `/blog cannibalization --api` with your own DataForSEO credentials. Local mode (default) requires no API |

All API keys and credentials are stored locally in your environment variables or `.env` files. This plugin never transmits your credentials to any party other than the service you are explicitly calling.

## Data Residency
